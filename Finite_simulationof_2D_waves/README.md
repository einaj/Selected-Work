This repository contains my solution to the wave project in IN5270, fall 2019.

The project instructions are given as *wave_project_instructions.pdf*.

The folder *code* contains all of the programs written for the project.

wave2D.py       --      the main class for solving the wave equation
plot_wave.py    --      for producing some of the animations
convergence.py  --      computes convergence
test_wave2D.py  --      nosetests for verifying the wave2D class
source_term.py  --      help script for finding source term with sympy
tsunami.py      --      uses wave2D to look at a physical problem

The folder *figs* contains all figures and movies generated in the project, and it is recommended to have a look at the .mp4 files for visualization.

The file *wave_report.pdf* is the report, answering the project, going through the discretization of the equation, handeling of boundry conditions and error discussion.
